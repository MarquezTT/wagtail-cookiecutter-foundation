Photo Gallery Module
====================

The Photo Gallery module allows to create photo galleries easily. The normal way to create photo galleries in Wagtail takes time. Suppose you have to add 100 photos to an example gallery, in normal way you have to choose photos one by one so it takes time. With this module you can add large number of photos to galleries easily. 

We uses tag approach to make this possible. The steps to create Photo galleries with this module are 

* Go to Images section in Wagtail admin and click on Add an Image.

* Drag and drop images you want in your gallery and add common tag name to all Images. You can also add same tag name to existing images if you want them in your gallery.

* Now create a Gallery Index page which displays all your galleries.

* Create a Gallery Page and enter the tag name same as above. You can also choose a feed image so it can appear in Gallery index page.

* Your Gallery is now created with all images you want. Awesome, right?
